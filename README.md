## How?
disCount aims to assist advanced students as well as students who are new to accounting.
This is achieved by letting the user decide wether to use the help of the computer to solve
exercises or do it themselves. Furthermore tools like "solution-suggestions" or
"automated exercise-correction" were developed to enable students to get feedback more easily
when studying on their own.

## Solution-suggestions
Users can upload solutions which can the be downloaded and rated by other users. Solutions with
lots of likes get displayed before those with fewer likes or more dislikes. Furthermore solutions
can be discussed in the comment section.

## Exercise-correction
To get feedback on a completed exercise the task can be submitted to an auto-correction which will
then mark wrong/missing content

## Online Exams
To start an online exam, teachers can start a session and students can join. The teacher can start
the exam and students begin to work. When they are done or when time is up, the solutions are handed
in, auto-corrected by disCount and the achieved points of the students are displayed on the teachers monitor in real-time.
At the end a simple statistic displaying the success-rate for different exercises is provided for the
teacher in charge.

## Disclaimer
The software was written as a school-project after I taught myself programming for about a year -> code is not well written/commented!

Project will possibly be rewritten in the future when the opportunity arises.
